# Corrupted-Memory
C# project from Spring 2015 semester.
A drinking game based on the card game Memory. The player is asked to choose a beverage for herself, and another for the computer. On a losing turn the AI imbibes a sip of its drink. As the game progresses, if the AI was given an alcoholic beverage, it begins to play poorly and becomes chatty -- eventually attempting to sing On Top of Old Smokey. Features delayed text presentation, to mimick human responsiveness, and assets I don't have to right to use (i.e., the card images are all from sci-fi shows and movies). It also includes a work-around that still needs to be properly fixed.
